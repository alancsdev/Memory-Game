# How to play!

To win you must find all pairs of animals, the cards with the animals will be shuffled at the beginning of the game.

You have 3 minutes to find all the pairs, to do this you just need to choose 2 cards, if the animals are the same, you get 1 point, if they are different, the chosen cards will be turned face down and you must try again.
If you make a mistake 7 times or the time runs out, you lose.
